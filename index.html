                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Philadelphia before moving to Bristol where I attended The Red Maids' School. I studied Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Birmingham. I focused on Islam and Mathematics and studied at the University of Melbourne for a year. I was the Valedictorian for the graduating class of 2018.</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>Film-making has been a passon of mine for many years. I have made several short films and spent a year working on a TV series. <br>I also enjoy travelling and recently explored nine US national parks. I found it particularly interesting to learn about the Native American tribes as part of this trip.</p>

                    <p>I am hoping that this course will provide me with the opportunity to develop my coding and design skills so that I may begin my career in Web Development. The combination of creativity and logic is of particular interest to me. I hope that this course will be challenging and allow me to start my career in an innovative field.</p>
